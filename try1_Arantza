# now we move on to the model reduction
# our model:
# m0 <- lmer(yield ~ pd * environment * genotype + (1|environment:pd:block:rep), data = yield)

drop1(m0)

# interaction pd:environment:genotype can be deleted
m1 <- update(m0, . ~ . - pd:environment:genotype)

# interaction pd:genotype can be deleted
m2 <- update(m1, . ~ . - pd:genotype)
drop1(m2)

#Since AIC of /none/ is the lowest, we stop reducing it, this meaning:
# WE FOUND THE MINIMAL ADEQUATE MODEL:
# m2 <- lmer( yield ~ pd + environment + genotype + pd:environment + environment:genotype + 
#     (1 | pd:environment:block:rep), data = yield)

#I think the problem with the m2 above is the order of the random effects 
m2  <- lmer(yield ~ pd + environment + genotype + pd:environment + environment:genotype + (1 | environment:pd:block:rep), data = yield)
# NOW WE TEST validity OF THE MODEL with the reduction
